                <p>i bought a rose and a bottle of wine 
                    that afternoon
                    i had planned on asking her to picnic with me at the lake
                    something i'm not known for
                    but i'd found the courage
                    the scene was set in my mind
                    steak, i'll read a stupid poem i wrote about how she reminds me of some aspect of nature
                    (probably a flower i haven't compared another woman to)
                    she'll swoon, because who else would write a heartfelt poem for her?
                    certainly not adam
                    (god i fucking hate that guy)
                    and at the end of it, i'll uncork the wine and pour us both a glass,
                    and if i'm feeling particularly ballsy we'll share a cigarette
                    
                    we'll gaze into the water
                    our eyes will meet in the rippling reflection
                    she'll turn to me and i to her
                    she'll say i'm the only one who's ever made her feel this way
                    she tells me
                    i'm enough
                    in fact i'm all she's ever wanted
                    i'm perfect she'd say
                    and the sun will set as soon as our lips meet
                    i'll place the rose gently in her hair
                    and we will be 
                    one
                    my tattered heart suddenly sewn together again
                    
                    there it was, the perfect first date
                    this was going to be the one that would finally turn my life around
                    one great romantic tale about a downtrodden guy becoming brand new because of a woman.
                    
                    as i was having these thoughts,
                    i realized i had devolved her into an idealistic pastiche of who she really was
                    
                    it was 7 o clock, and i got into my car, drove to the lake and parked.
                    i unfurled the picnic blanket just as the sun was beginning to set
                    lying down and watching the water flow
                    and flow
                    
                    i decided not to invite her that night
                    this wasn't the right time for love
                    it wouldn't fix me
                    and it couldn't, even as badly as i wanted it to
                    
                    the realization only struck me after it was too late to turn back
                    but before i had made the mistake of asking her to come
                    
                    now i was alone at the lake
                    a rose in my hair
                    an empty bottle of wine
                    and the cannibalization of ego
