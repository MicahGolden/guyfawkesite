                <p>all day it runs through my mind
                    my latest obsession 
                    something that i want
                    something that i need
                    and it's all that i can think about
                    it works its way into nearly every conversation
                    into every aspect of life
                    it becomes my reason for existing
                    most don't get it
                    many will never understand 
                    they view it from a miopic lens of
                    "oh wow, that's great"
                    or they take my words at face value 
                    and that's dangerous for me
                    it embellishes my obsessive thinking 
                    making it more real
                    more attainable 
                    i get tunnel vision and ignore the flaws
                    begging for it to destroy me.
                    
                    whether or not it's healthy for me;
                    the red flags blend into my crazed mind
                    all day
                    i dream about it every night
                    i'm delusional i don't deserve this
                    i'll never get it
                    i drink i get even more crazed
                    but i still drink
                    
                    and jesus fucking christ it gets worse
                    
                    everyone knows
                    it's my identity
                    because it's all i want
                    it's all i need
                    i'm laying in bed all day
                    holy shit it's all i need
                    begging for it to kill me
                    it's all i fucking need
                    maybe if i just drink enough
                    i'll be lucky enough to make a mistake 
                    and ruin it all
                    because then
                    instead of obsessing over hypotheticals 
                    i'd have a real answer 
                    something i need so badly
                    but i'm not good enough
                    why would anyone want to deal with this
                    why would anyone love me
                    it's all i need
                    
                    the beauty in all of this
                    is that my obsession makes me fiercely loyal
                    to the point where
                    it's all i need
                    i take my pill
                    i take a drink
                    and the intrusive thoughts 
                    
                    dissipate
                    
                    until the solace leaves me
                    then immediately i remember every thing i said
                    why did i say that why did i say that
                    then i have to explain to my friends 
                    that evan hates me because of something 
                    riley said to grace
                    but evan doesn't even fucking know riley or grace
                    in fact, i don't even think they live in the same state
                    and alex wore green on thursday
                    but it was the 19th, which was a bad day in june
                    
                    and that's why she'll never love me
                    
                    the difference between this and pure social psychosis is that i know it's irrational
                    but i still compulsively beg for reassurance
                    "am i dying?"
                    "do you hate me?"
                    the answer is always yes until they say
                    no
                    and to those without a grasp on it
                    compulsions never make sense
                    but these questions don't leave my head if they go unanswered 
                    because
                    it's all i need
                    
                    it's all i fucking need.
