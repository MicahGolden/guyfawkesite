                <p>
                    breathe in
breathe out

have 
no doubt

all the words
from her mouth
mean

she's
not around

get ahold of myself
become a better person

as it goes on
the pain only 

worsens
and i hate
everyday

without
you

I'll be honest,
I looked back in time
and our memories made me realize
I always wanna be by your side

They say healing,
it takes some time
well my love its been some time
this love you can live inside

I write these songs
because it's the only way I can move on
but when I remember your smile
I find it so hard, 
to let go
because I'm not very good at that to begin with I guess
never have been, never will

I feel like we are meant to be,
now, this isn't the same, soulmates why don't you love me,
argument
but like
there's still something there, right?
as you push me out of your life?

oh my love it's been way to long
carve our initials in the sand
i wanna take your, hand.

concepts so distant to us now,
I finally know, how
to take the world, down
with you. 


I don't even know if you hear these songs.
I can't even send them to you
because
unless your words are
"I love you, come back, I need you" 
I don't want to hear from you at all.
