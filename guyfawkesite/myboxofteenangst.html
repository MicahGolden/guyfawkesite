            <div class="poem"><p>i open up one of the boxes,
              packed for me when i returned home
              inside are books upon books
              books i forgot i even had 
              what's this one? a tattered spiral notebook
              ah, shit, it's this old thing my teenaged poems
              well, my memory is pretty solid
              but god, the words i wrote back then
              much more methodical
              like i had something to prove 
              did i really feel this way?
              was love a robber-fly, melting my insides
              leaving me dead and hollow?
              at the time, i thought i was changing so much
              now i look at myself and don't recognize the 
              boy behind the feelings back then
              hell, i listen to my old songs and barely recognize
              the words
              i guess the most important thing in life really is
              growth 
              even if my writings are more
              dry
              the feelings behind them are more
              real
              maybe i'm happy to be my current self
              despite the pain it took to get here
              because it's worth it
              my friends say someday i'll get back what i tried
              to give
              and i sure hope that's true
