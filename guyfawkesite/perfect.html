                <p>
                    remember the nights when i held you under the light of the moon?
                    it was our first time and our last time too
                    tell the truth, you still think of me, you do.
                    take that hatred and resentment, yeah i call it my proof.
                    
                    cause youre perfect, in every little way it counts
                    i love your smile, and the way your voice sounds
                    when youre saying my name, even if now the taste is bitter
                    you say i fucked up, well forgive me cause im a sinner.
                    
                    "day by day, i'm slowly waiting for it to fade.
                    maybe i hate you? well there's the thought of the day.
                    when the night comes and i'm left missing your warmth
                    the booze kinda helps, but even thats not as strong without you.
                    
                    cause youre perfect, never once made a mistake
                    only you have ever felt this strong heartbreak
                    or maybe you haven't, i can't tell what's in your head
                    only the impact, of the words you haven't quite yet said.
                    
                    call me up, i'll be waiting around all day
                    or tell me to fuck myself, pretend our love was fake
                    love isn't perfect, but in time youll figure out
                    on your doorstep, left a postcard send it south"
                    
                    cause, love isnt perfect and so quickly can it fade
                    just fucking kidding, i still love you to this day
                    youre holding your feelings in, honestly i'm ashamed.
                    or maybe your love was just something cheaply homeade.
                    
                    i want you to cut me, choke me, spit me out
                    i'm puffing a cigarette need nicorette no doubt
                    this song isn't attacking you, just simply pointing out
                    that:
                    
                    love isn't perfect, we all make some mistakes
                    not saying what i did was anywhere near okay
                    but also consider this, your imperfections facing me
                    i don't remember them, mostly the good things.
                    
                        you say it this pain is too much to forgive
                        i call your bluff, because remember when i did?
                        i feel the same pain waiting in the rain alone
                        everyday is meaningless, we're playing the same game
                        the drugs are powerful, the freedom is calling your name
                        give me your dirty, painful love ill give you the same
                        give me your bloody, reckless love ill give you the same
                        cut my throat and spill my blood and i'll love you the same
