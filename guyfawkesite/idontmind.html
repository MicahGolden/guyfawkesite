                    lately ive 
been dreaming of times
when life seemed
to make much more sense
and i don't like it
but i don't mind it 

your heart is broke
so ill just smoke
is there any flame left inside?
do you feel it?
can you see it?

i don't want
to misconstrue
i know our love is over now, its true
the way things were, 
just wasntt right
and i don't like it
but i don't mind it

to see you again,
to see me for the first time,
i think it's time for something new,
and i would love to,
but what can i do?

it seems like everything,
has happened this way for a reason
yes i'm growing, but it pains me inside
and i don't like it
but i neeeded it

to live a life 
with a love worth dying for,
whats that feel like, to you-?
is this it?
do i mean it?

it's so hard to see me in 
a brand new light, i'm sure
itll take time for open eyes,
but if love is still breathing,
is your heart still beating?



is your heart beating?

two ways, across the street
one day our souls will meet
in a field of daisies
and well both be smiling, again

and i don't know when
but is your heart still beating?
