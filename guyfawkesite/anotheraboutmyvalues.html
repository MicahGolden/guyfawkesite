            <div class="poem"><p>i want to earn the right
              to settle down
              but before i get there
              i want to drink,
              smoke,
              fuck,
              love,
              love so fucking much 
              that it's not our plan,
              it just ends up that way.
              "come home
              it's late"
              ha, remember when we'd stay out late?
              now i'm being asked to come home
              and as i drive home i have a cigarette
              i laugh at the juxtaposition
              "she used to love getting drunk,
              what happened?"
              then i look in the rearview 
              at the aged bearded man that looks at me   
              constantly 
              "oh yeah,
              that's what"
              i wave goodbye to the man smoking a cigarette
              walk up the steps
              unlock the door
              arms folded, big chair
              "it's about time"
              "yeah yeah, i know" 
              sloppy kisses positioned behind an enraged
              partner 
              "sorry babe"
              "i love you too"
              sleep
              warmth
              sleep
