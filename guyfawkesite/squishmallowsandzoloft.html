                <p>
                    lately i've,
been thinking a lot.
i've been in my head
wishing i was dead
but i'm alive.

then i remember,
"what the fuck?"
when i started working on myself, it felt like i gave up.

now we're here,
and shit's the same.
except you gave up and pushed me away.

and that's fine,
but isn't it funny?
that you're focused on yourself
and now we're here again?

except i,
never gave up.
sure, i broke the pieces but i begged to put them back in the places they belonged in.

oh, oh,
don't you see
what i did to you,
you're now doing to me?

you say it's not
your responsibility.
but as for me, i care for everyone i meet.

so go ahead,
focus on yourself.
maybe you'll come out better,
then end up hating yourself.

what's so wrong?
wrong with that?
to put yourself first,
well what's so wrong with that?

you push away,
the ones you love.
your'e right, it's conditional,
but the only condition is you love me the same.

and now,
i can't hear your voice.
it hurts to think of you and it's nothing but pure fucking noise.

well shit,
have you ever had a dream,
that you killed yourself because you couldn't be with me?

i didn't think so,
well that's every night.
i can't talk to you because when i do i want to die.

and i guess,
i'll just move on,
and when i do you better remember this fucking song.

the way
you made me feel,
i guess it's still the part of me that believes true love is real.

fuck.
