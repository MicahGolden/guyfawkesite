                    sometimes life, it kicks us down,
and happy days are nowehre to be found
you can get a tattoo on your chest
but you gotta figure out the rest

the things we do for love, can feel so pointless
but it takes time keep your head up,
daddy told me it's all my fault,
rotting in the ground, with daises on my grave

I planted the seeds, but they won't grow
don't know why, only she knows

lady at the bar asks if im okay,
say I don't know, what's that mean?
"you kind look down, slightly depressed"
"oh, can you see is it that obvious?"

well, sometimes life it kicks us down,
and happy days are nowhere to be found
you can get a tattoo on your chest
but you gotta figure out, all the rest


I carved your name onto my wrist,
a permanent reminder of all this
like it's not stuck in my brain
blow it out, end the pain.

now suicides not what I mean,
the gun is: calling you again.
metaphorically im insane
but baby love, why did it wane?

well sometimes life, man it gets rough
your hearts on the ground, will she pick it up?
lay it on the line, say this is it
she shakes her head, like she doesn't need it

the way that we love, can feel so cold
hey man, give her your heart and soul
or give up quick, if you can't endure
but look at her, tell her your love's pure.
