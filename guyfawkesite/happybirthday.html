                    happy birthday sunshine,
                    i want to take you somewhere weve never been before.
                    your legs are bound to get tired,
                    so put on your comfortable shoes.
                    
                    here at the top of our world,
                    this is where i think i'd ask you.
                    let's carve our initials in the wood
                    and leave a mark on this world.
                    
                    the slope is greatly stepening
                    i'd carry you if you want me to.
                    you say my arms aren't strong enough,
                    but these arms won't break, dear.
                    
                    happy birthday starlight,
                    i want to sing you some words.
                    won't you look into my eyes,
                    and see that my sunshine is you?
                    
                    because i, don't want to, die alone,
                    i want to die in your arms.
                    
                    and i want to hold you closer, 
                    don't want you to worry, anymore,
                    
                    anymore
                    anymore
                    
                    happy birthday, lovely,
                    you got all dressed up for this.
                    i guess i should have told you we'd be walking
                    but your sweat shimmers on your skin.
                    
                    you are the only one i think of
                    when i remember happiness.
                    i love the way you did your hair,
                    even if you think it looks like shit.
                    
                    because i don't want to, die alone.
                    i want to die in your arms.
                    
                    and i want to hold you closer,
                    don't want you to worry, anymore, 
                    anymore.
                    
                    anymore.
