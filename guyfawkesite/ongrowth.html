            <div class="poem"><p>so many times people get complacent
              they get too comfortable in the way things are
              and aren't able to grow within the soil
              because, hey, it provides what it needs to
              a major fault in some human's minds
              the soil becomes a given 
              "well duh, you'll always be here, you have to be!"
              but each time it rains the composition changes
              you begin to nurture someone who won't
              ever, never ever, understand that it's changed
              once uprooted they promise and swear they will
              but when that happens, it's because they're
              uncomfortable, without the consistency
              you're tired of being the soil
              maybe you want to be the flower for once
              and then you meet someone else
              willing to be your soil
              or maybe willing to grow alongside you 
              but that's unfamiliar and scary
              so you find another plant to be soil to
              this time, they don't even want your brand
              but they keep you around "just in case"
              how is that fair?
              maybe your roots get entangled 
              but you're drinking from the same water 
              it's unhealthy for both of you 
              but they don't care
              you need to realize that you need to grow 
              side by side
              not entwined
              then
              and only then
              can you feel love
