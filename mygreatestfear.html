            <div class="poem"><p>alphabetize your memoirs
              the thousands of letters you've written to people who don't care anymore
              life used to seem so simple
              too simple in fact
              so simple you pushed them out of it
              now life is EXCITING
              so exciting that everyone you meet is more interesting than the last
              you don't even remember their names anymore
              and you're self-destructive, burning yourself with every cigarette 
              pledging to quit when the right person comes around
              but, hey, maybe they smoke too
              maybe they don't 
              maybe their vices will be worse than the bottle and pack
              at the same time, maybe they'll be an avid church-goer
              not sure how you'll manage that, 
              alcoholic, nicotine-addicted, bipolar you
              but someone out there is sure to love you the way you are now
              you swear up and down "i'm better! i promise!"
              but to those who never saw you suffer
              well, at least the same suffering as back then,
              you're just you
              that's alright
              i'm alright
              sometimes i wonder if i wear my heart on my sleeve 
              like it's too obvious
              but then i remember how hard it is to tell someone i'd like to get to know them
              no fear at all unleashing the torrent of emotions i have in my soul
              but god forbid i make the object of my desires aware
              maybe that's a good thing
              the worst that can happen is i look like an idiot
              THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT
              honestly, my greatest fear, besides hurting another living being, is hurting my own pride
              and i LOVE apologizing
              but if it's to someone who won't hear it
              then god, i just made an ass of myself
              trying to fix something that means nothing these days
              sorry i stepped on your new shoes
              didn't see you there
              and now they hate me.
