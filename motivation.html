            <div class="poem"><p>any given week
              there's one day i have enough energy to really
              feel fine
              most days i force myself to get out of bed
              because i know it's what's best for me
              to see my friends
              to just go outside for a bit
              but i can't do it
              yet i do
              answering a text can be too much at times.
              depending on who it is, 
              my response is carefully calculated
              not to say it's not genuine 
              but there are so many possibilities
              i just want to choose the right one
              on that one day
              i let myself flow a little better
              live in the moment 
              maybe it's because i have to
              and somehow the people i'm around
              seem to like me
              but any other day
              i think they hate me
              "maybe i'll just stay in this weekend"
              i say to myself
              but i never do
              and i always end up happier for having gone out
              but a part of me wonders
              what well is my drive coming from?
              will it run dry?
              is my motivation what'll happen next weekend?
              is it the next?
              or the next?
