                    remember when we went,
                    leaving our attachments behind
                    travelling down the highway 
                    together, our love in tow
                    
                    we went to the shore, i'd never been there before
                    you told me not to worry about the jellyfish on the floor.
                    
                    the first thing that we saw,
                    was those stupid spitting mollusks
                    you've always hated them, and honestly i can see why
                    
                        standing on the outside,
                        looking in.
                        and waiting for the day to come.
                        when i can show you all my love the way i should have done.
                    
                    my favorite memory,
                    was when you were next to me
                    in the pale blue water and we saw a little turtle
                    
                    i wish we could have taken him home
                    but i guess we kinda did
                    because whenever were alone it felt like everywhere was home
                    
                    when we got back to our room,
                    we got drunk and turned the ac as low as it could go, never felt more at home
                    
                    watching lifetime and qvc
                    you know what that shit meant to me?
                    
                    none of the things we did made sense, but i've never been so in love.
                    
                        standing on the outside,
                        looking in.
                        and waiting for the day to come.
                        when i can show you all my love the way i should have done.
                    
                    our squishmallow friends,
                    the nights that never end,
                    at least until we threw up on the floor.
                    
                    here i go again,
                    reminiscining on the past.
                    but honestly, what i want most is a future with you.
                    thinking about all that's left,
                    for me and you to do.
                    missing all the precious moments too soon.
                    
                    thank you for being my best friend,
                    i'll love you until my end.
                    too many messages i can't send.
                    
                    please don't forget me,
                    only if you can.
                    only if you can.
                    only if you can
                    
                    please don't forget me,
                    only if you can.
                    only if you can.
                    only if you can.
                    
                    only if you can.

                    saving my life
