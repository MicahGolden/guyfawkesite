                    waking up another day
                    i guess thats how i say
                    i think its all okay
                    
                    my throat is sore as shit
                    my old clothes finally fit
                    and im a brand new man now
                    
                    checking on my phone
                    i feel so fucking alone
                    why the fuck are there so many girls named sydney in this town
                    
                    and my brain is running wild
                    when can we reconcile?
                    maybe shes with that one guy, you know that one yeah I always hated him
                    
                    and i have dreams we fuck still
                    should i stop taking my pills?
                    after all its the whole reason were here to begin with
                    
                    waking up another day
                    i guess thats how i say
                    i think its all okay
                    
                    i smoked two packs last night
                    why the fuck is that alright?
                    killing myself slowly feels better than a gun, anyways
                    
                    ill find me a nice goth girl
                    then ill show her the world
                    im the man you wanted now, but its all pointless anyhow
                    
                    who the fuck am i kidding
                    i still see this as a beginning
                    bath and body works doesnt hit the same without you
                    (what?)
                    
                    drinking another day
                    i guess thats how i say
                    im lying and im not okay
                    
                    maybe you wanted a broken man?
                    well honey, im a broken man
                    but now i just hate myself a little bit less
                    
                    maybe you wanted a better man?
                    well honey, im a better man
                    but now I just hate myself a little bit more.
                    
                    waking up another day
                    fuck no im not okay
                    but ill wake up tomorrow

                    and honey its a shame
                    honey its a shame
