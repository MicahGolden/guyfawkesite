                <p>
                    first there's trenton.
                    now here's a guy i hope you get to meet, 
                    just because he'll make you laugh at first, but then you'll realize what kind of guy he is.
                    i was at the bar one night with a close friend of mine. she's kind, funny, full of energy in social places.
                    and trenton and his friend come up to us, trying to fuck my friend i guess, 
                    and he offers me a smoke. probably trying to get me away from the seat next to her.
                    i recognize his friend a little, so i take it, but end up placing it in my pocket.
                    he begins to drunkenly attempt to swoon my friend, and commments on her style, her appearance.
                    she doesn't immediately register as "edgy" but clearly presents her mannerisms that way once you talk about music.
                    i joke around and say "this guy's friend is cool, but i don't know about trenton! better watch out!"
                    and he, in a drunken stupor, takes mild offense.
                    he laughs, but then comments on my black nail polish.
                    "m-man, i, i've been there and uh, the, the nails aren't the way to go if you want to get laid man."
                    i laugh and say "ah shit, guess i'm not taking you home tonight." 
                    my friend sticks up for my painted fingers and says "hey, i like them! they look good!"
                    trenton quickly walks back his comment. "i-i mean, yeah umm. i mean yeah but i've been there! i've been there!"
                    i tell him "yeah man, well i didn't paint my nails to get laid. don't really give a shit about that."
                    him and his friend awkwardly laugh. my friend wasn't even single at the time, but if she was
                    his attempt at shaming me would have been futile.
                    life's a fucking joke, so the next time i see him i say hi.
                    he comes up to me, hammered as hell and says some racist shit, don't remember, i was drunker.
                    then, he and his friend talk about going to another bar, but "only after one more".
                    they get three more, and trenton comes up to me:
                    "m-man, i'd, i'd fuck you, i-i'd fuck you if you, if you shaved man."
                    i laugh, convincingly, yet uncomfortably.
                    "s-seriously man, i mean, you-you shave the beard let's... let's talk..."
                    he walks away, his friends realize he's fucked up. 
                    guess he didn't mind the nail polish.
                    
                    now that i've introduced you to trenton, let's talk about his friend, daryl.
                    daryl was a man i met one saturday when i was hanging out with some old friends from high school.
                    this guy brings his skateboard everywhere. it's interesting at first, but childish when sober.
                    we first talked when he noticed some of the similiarly-aged to me women i was sitting with looked over at his
                    attempts to do skateboard tricks in the back.
                    i cheered him on. "do a flip! do a flip!" 
                    since i was the only one giving him any verbal attention, he says "for a dollar!" 
                    i tell him "oh never mind then ha" and 30 seconds later he does a flip.
                    the table cheers for him, half-heartedly and i clap loudly.
                    he tells me some shit about his life, can't quite remember, and i listen.
                    a week later, i'm hanging out with a friend of mine. a trans-woman with a great attitude.
                    she is hilarious, but on this particular night she was feeling really down. 
                    we talked, i comforted them, shared similar stories, and made sure they felt better emotionally than when they sat down.
                    hours pass and i'm in the back smoking.
                    daryl sits next to me and tells me 
                    "yo bro you know that girl is a guy right?"
                    i look curiously and say "umm, i am very aware she is trans, but i don't really know why that matters?"
                    "well man, i just, i saw you talking to them and didn't want you to be tricked."
                    i pause, astonished. 
                    "um, well she is my friend and i'm not trying to fuck them."
                    unbelievable to me, that this person whom i had no ill-will towards made such a brazenly disrespectful comment.
                    something something bro-code? jesus christ. the first conversation i had with my friend involved them
                    clearly disclosing their identity to me, probably because she felt she had the need to to avoid interactions like what i had.
                    something in my brain switches, and despite the shots upon shots of whiskey in my system i say:
                    "i don't really understand what point telling me that has. she's a person like everyone else, it's not your job to project your own values onto her identity."
                    the asshole backtracks and continues the whole "just looking out for you bro!" rhetoric.
                    someone i had no ill-will towards became someone i loathed seeing.
                    and the kicker is, he claims to be an og punk. 
                    
                    finally, the character i know the most about. his name is reagan.
                    reagan is a man nearing 40. he's actually the first person i talked to upon returning to this town.
                    i saw him sitting at the bar and struck up a conversation. i recognized him from my yougner days, as we played a card game at the same hobby shop.
                    unlike the last two men, he's actually a lot more self-aware. he has some form of chronic anxiety, i'm sure.
                    the first night we saw eachother at the bar, he actually ended up buying me a drink or two as we caught up.
                    we had some fun, talked some shit, and went our seperate ways.
                    one night, i drove him to a different bar (he doesn't have a car, or a license at least) and we ended up returning to our home base.
                    he offered to buy me some drinks, and i happily accepted. i did drive him home frequently, after all.
                    when the time came for him to pay, his card got declined.
                    he was able to afford a little more than half of the tab, but as his ""friend"" i was asked to pay for the rest of it.
                    i did, but after that i never trusted him again.
                    that's not where the problem lies, however.
                    everytime he sees a woman, he instantly goes up to them.
                    "hey, how's it going? you here alone?"
                    totally not a creepy a pickup line. 
                    the woman usually says "oh i'm here with some friends" in a dismissive way
                    his go-to is "oh yeah? can i meet them too?"
                    sometimes they oblige, other times they awkwardly say no.
                    but there's one specific woman he seems to have an attraction to. 
                    at least, did.
                    my understanding is that they actually hit it off initially, not entirely sure why.
                    he's not ugly, but he's also very... awkward. 
                    and not an endearing way, but a very, "holding myself back from touching your thigh" way.
                    i asked him about his intereactions with this woman, and he's always very arrogant.
                    "yeah, guess she just couldn't handle me" shit like that.
                    he's had a shit life, so i get why he's drawn to the bottle.
                    but outside of his terrible pickup lines, like trenton, 
                    every fucking time i see him he always tells me "shave your beard and we can fuck."
                    the straightest, most hard-ass bar douchebags always want to fuck me.
                    and that's not a brag either, i'm a rugged motherfucker. beer belly, beard, hairy arms, hairy ass.
                    i just wish they'd leave me the fuck alone! 
                    
                    anyways, that's enough of that. 
                    three barflies
                    three stories
                    four drunks.
