              "what's that?" my sister asks
              strong hesitation from me, 
              but i'm the older brother so i feign confidence 
              i pour the packets upon packets of sauce out
              "it's a bumble bee!" his wing is hurt, 
              crushed under the weight of 
              packets upon packets 
              "ah! what should we do?!"
              well, life is precious, and so is this
              little fuzzy fellow
              "let's take him outside, set him free!"
              i grab the paper bag,
              and there it is
              pour him out on the ground, making sure to be
              gentle
              he shakes, scared, definitely hurt
              "poor little guy"
              a moment passes and he
              flies away
              "goodbye mr bumblebee!"
              two days later
              by the pond flora
              buzz buzz buzz
              i could recognize that fluffy bumble from across
              the state
              good to know that mr bumblebee
              is bumbling around
              must be a nice neighborhood
