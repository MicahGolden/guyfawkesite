                  i drink 
              way too fucking much 
              but holy shit 
              you look so pretty!
              well 
              you always have and 
              do 
              but 
              i guess getting drunk
              really just loosens my 
              inhibitions
              and makes me feel 
              good
              hi im micah and im an alcoholic 
              but also 
              isnt a.a. a fucking religious thing 
              maybe theres a thirteenth step 
              accepting the things i cannot change 
              man fuck that 
              just drink in moderation 
              under the supervision of the state of texas 
              now THAT is a force greater than myself 
              oh shit should i leave 
              sorry guys
