            <div class="poem"><p>when i was 20 i ended up landing a job at a retail store unloading trucks.
              it was a period in my life where i was having trouble finding good work, during the pandemic.
              i was unemployed for about 6 months because i was tired of my last job and felt like it treated me like shit. had some friends there, but i refused to play the "try and move up" game, as one does when they're 20.
              i began my job hunt after going to the beach with the woman i was with at the time and started applying to anything i could find. plenty of good positions i thought i could fill, but the one that called me back first was for a retail truck unloading gig. hard labor! something i'd never done before. 
              
              i finally get the job and they make us go through orientation, typical of any position at a major company, and it was all a bunch of propaganda about how much they love minorities and queer folk. lovey dovey shit to distract from the fact that this was just another corporation more than happy to lay us off once the holiday season had ended.
              funnily enough, this was also a company that cracked down hard on the protests in 2020 within their own stores. they also somewhat recently walked back pride month merchandise in fear of upsetting homophobic pieces of shit. to say that their claims of allyship were merely disingenuous would be an understatement.
              one thing that stuck out to me was that they prided themselves on "donating 50% of their campaign contributions to democrats and 50% to republicans"... now, i know they pick and choose the candidates based on who will give them the highest tax breaks and quell fears of unionization, but at face value, don't those contributions cancel each other out?
              
              after the indoctrination ceremony, i come to find out that my typical shift is expected to be 12am-8am.
              as an unemployed man, my sleep schedule was 3am-12pm, so this would be a major lifestyle inconvenience, but i didn't have many other options at the time.
              i go home, tell my partner about how it went and she laughed, but also showed some concern over the fact that our schedules would be incompatible for a while.
              i was dreading it. my first thought after discovering my new schedule was that i'd be completely removed from the day-to-day routine i had grown accustomed to.
              and i was.
              
              my first day on the line, the team lead barely noticed me. i was told to "lift the boxes off the line, and put them on the pallets."
              i did just that, and time flew by. 
              i had no mutual interests with the people i worked with and they had their cliques established so i felt out of place.
              after we finished, i was shocked to learn that we would also be stocking shelves, something not in the job description at all. but "hey, more hours is good right?!"
              at the time, my calling card was my sloth. and as it turned out, there was yet another truck coming!
              yippee, my body aches and i'm running off of 2 hours of sleep, but here it comes!
              6am now,  and a beast of a truck loads into the bay. 2,500 items. we begin and it goes on and on. i'm waiting for it to end. 
              
              at this point in my life i'm having the occasional panic attack, and it just so happens to strike me in the moment.
              i remove myself from the line and call my partner, asking her if she can pick me up after work. 
              luckily she says she can, and plans to take an uber to my store so she can drive me and my car home.
              after we hang up, i begin to weep. feeling like a failure, feeling scared, all of that, and my glasses plop into the toilet. 
              i take them out, on a normal day i'd laugh about it but this made me spiral even worse.
              i eventually trek back to the unloading zone and my coworkers ask where i was.
              "taking a long shit", i say.
              they laugh and i fake a smile. life goes on and eventually we finish.
              thank god we didn't have to stock this round, as it was finally time for us to leave.
              
              my partner arrives and drives us home.
              "thanks for picking me up, had a shit day."
              "of course, but this is just a one time thing."
              "i know, i know, i'm sorry."
              i continued working there for a couple of months until the season ended. occasionally striking up banter with my coworkers, but never quite being accepted. all sports types and wannabe womanizers.
              on a typical night after returning home, i'd hit the bottle and play video games as my partner slept.
              removed from the outside world,
              isolated from my love,
              and weeping constantly.
