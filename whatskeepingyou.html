                <p>
                    whats been keeping you from forgiving me
                    whats been keeping you from telling me
                    to come home right now
                    have you not drank enough yet?
                    
                    have you not heard my songs of loving
                    the words that i said about how
                    life without this love is pain
                    life within this love is pain
                    
                    i guess i get it, darling
                    i don't know if i can forgive 
                    the way you made me face the gun,
                    or calling that fucking hotline but,
                    
                    i'll look passed all that,if you love me
                    because one day we'll flip, suddenly
                    missing the old days
                    the way we used to play, in the night
                    
               
                    
                    my love is strong
                    wrote you a letter, but can't send it yet
                    words too bold, might regret it
                    
                    
                    
                    whats been keeping you from crying?
                    whats been keeping you from believing
                    i can give you love, the way you've always wanted me to
                    
                    my ego has been crushed, and burned out
                    finally i'm the guy you wanted
                    let's go buy a house, have a kid, theres no doubt in my mind
                    
                    hold on to the flame, of passion
                    i'm living life without you, but i'm dying
                    to have you in my arms, 
                    and start over again
                    
                    i want you to burn me out, and use me
                    isn't it such a shame, to lose it?
                    4 long years gone by,
                    now you'd let it die?
                    
           
                    
                    and im so weak,
                    let you drive me to the edge
                    because i feel incomplete
                    
                    and baby if you're listening
                    then why the fuck aren't you calling me back?
                    
               
                    
                    what's been keeping you from remembering?
                    what's been keeping you from forgetting,
                    all the pain you hold onto
                    like the way you should be onto my hand
                    
                    i'm sorry to say that i, still think that
                    eternal love is where we're at
                    see you in 20 years,
                    wasting all these years in between
