                everyone is always trying to sell you something
                whether it be this asshole and his poems
                or the man at the bar who knows you've had too much
                but wants a tip
                and you'll write 40% on the receipt all the same
                everyone is always trying to sell you something
                its the shameless salesman in the mall suggesting financing
                its the woman who tells you you're the only one she'll ever love
                and you'll give her love all the same
                our transactional society commodifies life, 
                it commodifies death,
                people sell their bodies with pride
                people sell their thoughts without shame
                the homeless work for food 
                like it's a luxury instead of a foundation of being alive
                the common man sells his time to a corporation that lacks empathy
                and gives less than a shit about him
                everyone is always trying to sell something
                to live
                to take advantage of those who will 
                buy
                every building exists to generate profit
                no good exists when money is involved
                no heart exists when the almighty dollar is the backing
                poets write what others want to hear
                singers sing songs pre-penned by better singers
                and retail employees peddle products and credit cards they don't believe in
                but we'll buy it all the same
