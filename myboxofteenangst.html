                  I open up one of the boxes,
                  packed for me when I returned home.
                  Inside are books upon books,
                  books I forgot I even had.
                  
                  What's this one? A tattered spiral notebook,
                  ah, it's this old thing, my teenaged poems.
                  Well, my memory is pretty solid,
                  but the words I wrote back then...
                  
                  Much more methodical,
                  like I had something to prove.
                  Did I really feel this way?
                  Was love a robber-fly, melting my insides,
                  leaving me dead and hollow?
                  
                  At the time, I thought I was changing so much,
                  now I look at myself and don't recognize
                  the boy behind the feelings back then.
                  Hell, I listen to my old songs and barely recognize
                  the words.
                  
                  I guess the most important thing in life really is
                  growth,
                  even if my writings are more dry,
                  the feelings behind them are more real.
                  
                  Maybe I'm happy to be my current self,
                  despite the pain it took to get here,
                  because it's worth it.
                  
                  My friends say someday I'll get back what I tried
                  to give,
                  and I sure hope that's true.
