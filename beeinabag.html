                    rustle rustle
                    "what's that?" my sister asks
                    strong hesitation from me,
                    but I'm the older brother so I feign confidence
                    I pour the packets upon packets of sauce out
                    "it's a bumble bee!" his wing is hurt,
                    crushed under the weight of
                    packets upon packets
                    "ah! what should we do?!"
                    well, life is precious, and so is this
                    little fuzzy fellow
                    "let's take him outside, set him free!"
                    I grab the paper bag,
                    and there it is
                    pour him out on the ground, making sure to be
                    gentle
                    he shakes, scared, definitely hurt
                    "poor little guy"
                    a moment passes and he
                    flies away
                    "goodbye, Mr. Bumblebee!"
                    two days later
                    by the pond flora
                    buzz buzz buzz
                    I could recognize that fluffy bumble from across
                    the state
                    good to know that Mr. Bumblebee
                    is bumbling around
                    must be a nice neighborhood
