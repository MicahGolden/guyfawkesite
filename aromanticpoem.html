            <div class="poem"><p>i'm an easy person to please 
              too easy
              an ideal romantic outing for me 
              is really just existing together 
              somewhere nice
              a nice beer
              a bowl for two
              doesn't really matter to me
              i enjoy the odd adventurous evening
              one where we stroll along the trail
              no cell service so we get lost
              i look out on the sunset and say
              "isn't it beautiful"
              you say yes, you love sunsets
              and i say "i was talking about you"
              we picked the best day to come out
              because a torrent of rain falls from above
              our path is muddied
              for some reason we both wore our favorite shoes
              even though we're walking on a mix of mud 
              and gravel
              but it's still the perfect evening
              home now,
              my pretentious persona is evoked and i say
              "records and wine?"
              who could say no to that.
              uncork the bottle, flip the record over
              watching some old movie
              feeling safe for once
              like i'm really good enough
              i fall asleep before the credits roll
              but that's how it was always going to end
              could there be a better day than this?
