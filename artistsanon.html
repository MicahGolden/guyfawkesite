                <p>it's never a good thing to be inspired
                    because when we're happy
                    we don't feel the need to create
                    to write
                    to throw
                    to draw
                    because each stroke of the pencil
                    or indentation in the clay
                    is an outward expression of inner turmoil
                    so when my friends show their art
                    or i share a poem
                    i know it hasn't been a great day
                    it makes the finished piece damn good though
                    honestly, i have a lot of imposter syndrome
                    surrounding myself with people who can create
                    more than a scribble on a bar napkin
                    but i've learned to accept that my songs
                    my writings
                    are just as valid as their sculptures and paintings
                    because it all comes from the same place
                    the depths of a manic mind
                    that beautiful thing so few understand.
                    so few understand 
                    that even they can't make sense of it
                    so we create
