            <div class="poem"><p>i ordered some ink
              a book and paper for my typewriter
              forgot to check the shipping address
              sent it back to the old place
              no hesitation i texted you to give it to a mutual
              friend 
              a month ago i would be too scared 
              too desperate 
              to even attempt to talk to you
              but i guess i stopped caring
              took the time to
              so it doesn't hurt anymore
              funny how that works, huh?
              i really see you as just another body on this earth
              instead of the deity i had built you up as
              now, i actually feel nearly indifferent to you
              except the hurt you created in my life
              but that's all okay
              you always rejected the idea of keeping tabs
              but had a literal tab for me
              "because you'd do the same"
              bullshit, i'd have never done that
              shows how well you knew me
              shows how compatible we were
              the cynic, blind and refusing change
              miopic, unwilling to embrace the idea that
              two people can live separate lives, together
              because if it's not your life plan
              then it's nothing, yeah?
             
              i said i was indifferent, never said i don't have
              thoughts about the whole thing
              it just doesn't hurt to write about anymore
