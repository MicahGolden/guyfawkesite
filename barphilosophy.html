                    i went out alone the other night
                    different from how i usually go out "alone"
                    typically, i'll go to the bar knowing some of my drunken friends will be there;
                    we'll swap stories about our week, talk about music, usually someone will mention a woman.
                    usually me.
                    but this week has been one of those weeks that started out great
                    then quickly devolved into a prelude to my quarter-life crisis.
                    i found out too much this week.
                    artistic rejection, a close family friend died, discovered that someone whom i trusted for years
                    was really just lying to me to clear their own conscience.
                    the kind of lying that lead me to have an ego death because i believe every word.
                    the kind of lying that lead me to suicidal ideation when i thought it was the truth.
                    that kind of week.
                    so, i've resolved to stay inside my room and isolate myself this week.
                    
                    there's the expostion, 
                    so i went out alone the other night, right?
                    i was already drunk, cheaper to do so at home but i needed something to write about
                    so i headed to the only bar in town where i know it's unlikely i'll see anyone i know during the week.
                    i get a drink, head outside and begin to smoke.
                    immediately, i noticed a group of three men. they seemed to be invested in a conversation,
                    something about relatives, something about women.
                    then one of them loudly exclaims "where are all the BITCHES?!"
                    typically this gross display of misogyny would piss me off, but i have other things to worry about
                    so i retreat into my cell phone, still keeping an open ear.
                    
                    eventually, the older of the three men approaches me and introduces himself
                    hand extended, "hey there, my name is jack"
                    i shake his hand, "micah."
                    "i just saw you sitting out here alone, so figured i might as well say hi!"
                    he points to his table and i ask to sit with them.
                    he nods but points out that one chair is reserved for "her".
                    not sure who "her" is but i oblige and sit at the opposite end of the table.
                    
                    i take out a cigarette and hand one to jack as an offering.
                    "so anyways, there's this asshole, right? and he's a big motherfucker...
                    and, everyone is scared of this guy, but he's a pussy and doesn't know how to fight."
                    one of the other men interjects:
                    "ah yeah, just because yer big don't mean you can fight!"
                    "yeah, yeah, so he looked at me and called me a bitch. knocked his teeth right out!"
                    a woman walks by our table, and suddenly the conversation changes to one about the size of her ass.
                    i still haven't introduced myself to the other two guys, so i sit there awkwardly in awe at their lack of shame.
                    the conversation about the woman's ass dies down and i introduce myself
                    i learn that the other guys are named bill and jake.
                    "ha, jake and jack, i'll try to keep up with that", i say.
                    bill begins telling a story about how he let a close friend stay at his house for a while,
                    and his friend ended up trying to fuck his niece.
                    this was viewed as a cardinal sin, and to no surprise, bill brags about kicking the guy's ass.
                    why does it always end in violence?
                    i tell a story about a similar thing happening in my life and am met with "what was the guy's name?" as if that were an important detail.
                    drunkenly, i tell them and explain what kind of work he does for a living.
                    "oh yeah! i love smoking weed, i've met the man but don't much like him."
                    that closes off any interaction i'd have for the shelf life of my night here, but i stick around and listen some more.
                    jack opens up another conversation relating to violence.
                    "you can insult me, you can insult my sister, you can insult my mother, but don't you EVER insult my nieces or nephews!"
                    bill and jake both nod in agreement
                    "exactly! yer not ever gonna be tellin' me nothing about my niece"
                    bill points toward jake
                    "yer little girl and my son are sleepin' together right now, and i view 'er as a niece! ain't nobody gonna be talking shit about her in front of me.
                     unless they want their asses kicked."
                    jake applauds bill's dedication to kicking the asses of any who dare to speak ill of his "little girl"
                    
                    another woman walks by the table and this time the guys decide to have a classic philosophical conversation:
                    "tits or ass"
                    at this point, i'm kind of out of it and plan on leaving, but the allure of an actual intellectual conversation piques my interest.
                    
                    jack, well he's an ass guy of course. "you can't put your dick in a titty!"
                    solid enough justification.
                    bill, he's a connoisseur of the "fart box" as he called it. 
                    he's a big fan of slapping it around before "going to town".
                    jake, the odd one out, defends breasts.
                    he works at a strip club, so i assume he is the most well-informed of the bunch.
                    jake's bold defense of boobs riles up the other two guys.
                    "look, i enjoy a pair of tits as much as the other guy, but ain't nothing exciting happening there"
                    "yer just a dumbass jake. booze is rotting your damn mind."
                    
                    another man walks up and takes the seat they set aside from the mysterious "her" from earlier,
                    so i assume this guys name was "her".
                    he introduces himself to everyone at the table but me, and I discover his name is "Rodrigo".
                    
                    i get up, finally gotten to the bottom of the supposedly interesting conversation i had been missing out on,
                    get another shot of whiskey and drive home.
                    
                    once i land on my bed, i question my life decisions 
                    realizing that other people's conversations can be less exciting than being alone.
                    maybe next time i'll just take the handshake and enjoy being in a social environment by myself.
